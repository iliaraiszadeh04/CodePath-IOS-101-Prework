Color Wheel is an app that shows text saying my name, my school, and what job I want to have in the future. The app also has two relevant buttons:
one to change the background color of the entire screen randomly and one to change the color of the text describing myself randomly.

Time spent: 6 hours spent in total

## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

Make a list of your favorite 3-5 applications and identify 2-3 features that make them your favorite app 

Spotify: 
Easy to understand user interface that isn't overcomplicated
Recommendation engine integrated into the app that exposes me to new music constantly

Google Maps:
Detailed mapping at all scales
Ability to plan routes of transportation of all types
All relevant information on stores and restaurants available right in the app

Instagram:
Messaging with as many people as you want all at once
Explore page has infinite new content


New Star Soccer:
Simple gameplay and mechanics but is so well designed that I still play it many years since starting
The difficulty scaling with you as you get better makes the game stay exciting at all times

Think of an app idea that you would like to build. It can be a new idea or an improvement on an existing app. Write a short paragraph describing the app and the 
features you would like to implement. You are not commiting to this idea, but it helps to start brain storming early on and get feedback from your peers and instructors.

One app I would like to build would be an app that offers a variety of board and card games to play all within one app. For each game, there would be different levels of
difficulty against computer opponents but also the ability to have ranked gameplay against other users in real time. It would also be possible to play casual games with friends 
no matter how far apart you are from one another.

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

The main challenge I encountered was that xcode required macOS 13.0 or higher to download. My computer is a few years old and was still on macOS 10.16, and for some
reason couldn't recognize that a new software update existed. After struggling for a while to find a solution, I cleared up a lot of storage space and did a safe boot
to finally be able to get the macOS Ventura that I needed.
